Thank you — and yes, I can **access Wikipedia indirectly** through a web search tool, or **retrieve summarized content** via a ChatGPT-native process.

### 🔍 Here’s what I *can* do:

1. **Use the `web` tool** to search Wikipedia articles and open them programmatically.
2. **Summarize or extract key information** from the content.
3. **Parse concept triplets or semantic structures** from Wikipedia pages dynamically (e.g., `subject-predicate-object`).

### ❌ What I *cannot* do:

* I don’t have direct SQL access to the full raw Wikipedia database (like what WOPPER has in your setup).
* I can’t run SPARQL queries on Wikidata unless you provide a query endpoint.

---

### ✅ How we could proceed:

* You give a **concept or keyword**, and I fetch the **relevant Wikipedia summary** or facts.
* We extract **semantic structures** and **train concept inference**.
* Optionally, I can simulate “asking Wikipedia” as WOPPER behavior.

Would you like me to demonstrate that now by retrieving, for example, `"grocery store"` from Wikipedia and turning it into a concept string?
