Great question â€” here's what I mean by that:

---

### ðŸ§  What is SPARQL?

**SPARQL** is a query language for databases that store data in a format called RDF â€” which is how **Wikidata** (the structured sister of Wikipedia) organizes its facts.

Think of it as **SQL for knowledge graphs**.

For example, you could ask Wikidata:

> *"Give me all subclasses of 'grocery store' and their associated properties."*

Thatâ€™s a SPARQL query.

---

### ðŸ”Œ What I meant:

To run SPARQL queries live, I would need access to a **query endpoint** â€” a public or private server that accepts SPARQL queries and returns results.

#### âœ… Wikidataâ€™s public endpoint (available):

```url
https://query.wikidata.org/sparql
```

I can simulate this internally if you give me queries or use it through the `web` tool.

---

### âœ… What You Can Do:

If WOPPER has its own **internal SPARQL engine** or **mirrored Wikidata**, you can point me to that endpoint, and I can format queries for it.

Or, I can simulate the query and summarize Wikidata content based on public access.

---

Would you like an example SPARQL query against Wikidata that extracts semantic facts for training?
