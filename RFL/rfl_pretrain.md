Yes â€” in **Reflexive Fractal Logic (RFL)**, or any PyTorch model, you can absolutely **pre-train** or **manually set** weights (`w`) and biases (`b`) for layers before training. This can be useful for:

* Injecting prior knowledge
* Mimicking previously learned behavior
* Stabilizing early training in RFL networks

## âœ… Options for Pre-training or Initializing Weights in RFLNet

### ðŸ”§ 1. **Manually set weights and biases**

Example for one linear layer:

```python
with torch.no_grad():
    layer = model.blocks[0].proj_input
    layer.weight.copy_(torch.randn_like(layer.weight))   # or a custom matrix
    layer.bias.fill_(0.1)  # or any custom bias
```

Repeat for:

* `proj_input`
* `proj_resonance`
* `gate`
* `final`

---

### ðŸ§ª 2. **Use a custom weight initialization function**

Define a reusable function and apply it after creating the model:

```python
def init_weights(module):
    if isinstance(module, nn.Linear):
        nn.init.xavier_uniform_(module.weight)
        nn.init.constant_(module.bias, 0.01)

model.apply(init_weights)
```

---

### ðŸ§  3. **Load weights from a pre-trained model**

If you've trained an RFLNet before:

```python
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("rfl_trained.pt"))
```

---

### âœ… Why this matters for RFL:

In RFL, where layers must detect **recurring structure** and **resonance**, initializing weights in a way that encourages **balanced, symmetrical starting states** can improve:

* Early resonance detection
* Compression gate stability
* Latent convergence

Would you like a utility function to initialize all RFLBlock layers with structured priors?
