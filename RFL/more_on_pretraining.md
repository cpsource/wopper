Great question â€” here's exactly where and how to integrate the `seed_rfl_with_concepts()` utility into your existing `main()` function in your training script.

---

## âœ… Step-by-step Integration

### 1. **Import the function** at the top of your script:

```python
from seed_rfl_with_concepts import seed_rfl_with_concepts
```

---

### 2. **Insert the call right after model creation**, and before training begins:

```python
model = RFLNet(input_dim, hidden_dim, depth)

# ðŸ‘‡ Seed the first layer with your concept priors
concepts = [
    "freedom", "fear", "truth", "knowledge", "emotion",
    "constraint", "love", "loss", "ambiguity", "intuition"
]
seed_rfl_with_concepts(model, concepts, encode_text_to_vector)

# Proceed with training
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
```

---

## âœ… Updated `main()` snippet:

Hereâ€™s how your `main()` would look in context:

```python
def main():
    ...

    model = RFLNet(input_dim, hidden_dim, depth)

    # Inject concept-based priors into the first RFLBlock
    concepts = [
        "freedom", "fear", "truth", "knowledge", "emotion",
        "constraint", "love", "loss", "ambiguity", "intuition"
    ]
    seed_rfl_with_concepts(model, concepts, encode_text_to_vector)

    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)

    # Training loop
    ...
```

---

Let me know if you want the seeding to happen during evaluation too, or if you'd like a version that saves the seeded weights separately before training begins.
