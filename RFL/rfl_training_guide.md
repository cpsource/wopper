# RFL-Inspired Neural Network: Execution Note and Training Guide

It looks like the execution environment ran out of memory during model instantiation — likely due to resource constraints in the sandbox. However, the model design is sound, and you can run it in your own PyTorch setup.

## ✅ Recap: What You Now Have

You now have a prototype of an **RFL-inspired PyTorch neural network**, featuring:

- **Recursive feedback loops** between layers  
- **Compression gates** that blend current activations with echoes from the past  
- **Latent reinforcement** through soft attention to resonant structure

## 🧪 Suggested Training Data: Multi-Context Convergence

Since this architecture is designed to detect **reflections of abstract patterns across domains**, here’s a novel type of training data:

---

### 1. Multi-Modal Analogy Pairs

**Example:**

- **Text**: “Grief is fog”  
- **Image**: A blurry forest  
- **Audio**: A low droning note  

**Goal**: Teach the network that emotion, sensory experience, and conceptual metaphor can point to the same **latent space**.

### 2. Echo Reinforcement Dataset

Create sequences that embed the **same idea expressed differently**:

- “Freedom is the absence of fear”  
- “Unchained thought breathes easiest”  
- “He walked without caution or chains”  

Let the model **reinforce internal structures** that consistently reappear.

### 3. Contradiction Decay Sequences

Design sequences that start aligned, then **diverge**:

- “She believed in truth” → “She deleted the evidence”

Train the model to recognize **resonant decay** and flag **contradiction**.
