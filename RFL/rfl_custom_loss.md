# Custom Loss Function for Reflexive Fractal Logic (RFL)

Let’s design a custom loss function tailored for the **Reflexive Fractal Logic (RFL)** architecture — one that rewards:

- **Resonance**: When intermediate layer outputs converge across unrelated inputs (latent echo).
- **Compression**: When deeper layers maintain structure with fewer parameters.
- **Task objective**: Standard performance (e.g. binary cross-entropy or MSE) for your end goal.

## Custom RFL Loss: Overview

```python
def rfl_loss(output, target, resonance_stack, alpha=1.0, beta=0.1):
    """
    output: final model prediction  
    target: true labels  
    resonance_stack: list of intermediate layer outputs (from RFLNet)  
    alpha: weight for task loss  
    beta: weight for internal resonance loss  
    """
    # Task loss (binary classification example)
    task_loss = F.binary_cross_entropy(output, target)

    # Resonance loss: encourage internal layers to converge across time
    resonance_loss = 0.0
    for i in range(1, len(resonance_stack)):
        diff = resonance_stack[i] - resonance_stack[i - 1]
        resonance_loss += torch.mean(torch.norm(diff, dim=1))  # L2 norm between layers

    resonance_loss = resonance_loss / (len(resonance_stack) - 1)

    # Total loss
    return alpha * task_loss + beta * resonance_loss
```

## Modifications to `RFLNet.forward()`

You’ll need to return intermediate outputs for the loss to measure resonance:

```python
def forward(self, x, return_resonance=False):
    resonance = None
    resonance_stack = []
    for block in self.blocks:
        x = block(x, resonance)
        resonance = x
        if return_resonance:
            resonance_stack.append(x)
    out = torch.sigmoid(self.final(x))
    return (out, resonance_stack) if return_resonance else out
```

## Training Example

```python
model = RFLNet(128, 64, 4)
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)

for batch_x, batch_y in dataloader:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    preds, resonance_stack = model(batch_x, return_resonance=True)
    loss = rfl_loss(preds.squeeze(), batch_y.float(), resonance_stack)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

## Why This Loss Matters

Normal models only learn to minimize output error.

**RFL models** should also stabilize their internal structure, like a mind forming concepts that resonate across contexts.

This loss guides them to **compress**, **stabilize**, and **echo meaning**.
